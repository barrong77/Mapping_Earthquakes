# Mapping_Earthquakes
****See Map PNG File****

Project Overview
Maps allow us to explore, understand, and make decisions about our world. In this repository we will use javascript (GeoJSON) to create interactive maps to visualize earthquake data. GeoJSON data can be found in many apps that have a map feature such as ride-sharing, navigation, and food and package delivery services. Even location services on smart phones use GeoSJON format.

Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to show differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes.

Tasks
To complete this project, I used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website.

Output:
The map visualization can be viewed and interacted with in its entirity here.
Each earthquake is visually represented by a circle and color. The map has three views:

Satellite View
Dark View
Street View


Summary:
The user can also toggle between three layers to filter the data. This includes:

Tectonic Plates
Major Earthquakes (greater than 4.5 magnitude)
All Earthquakes
